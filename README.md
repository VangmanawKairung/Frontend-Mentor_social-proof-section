## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Sass/Scss

### What I learned

- The border radius of grid container have to be set by applying border radius in the border elements

### Continued development

Since the given design doesn't provide the hover state, so the future work will be handling with the hover state or active state to make the website more responsive.
